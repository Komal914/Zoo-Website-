      Pandas are pretty interesting. They spend most of the day eating bamboo
      and then the rest of it going to the bathroom. They can poop up to 40
      times on average and spend about 12 hours a day eating. While this may
      seem bizzare, they actually need to do this to stay healthy. They only
      digest about a fifth of what they eat and need to maintain their body
      weight.
