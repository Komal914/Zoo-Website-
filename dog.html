      Dogs are domestic animals and are descendants of the wolf species. They
      generally live up to 10-13 years. There are many different types of dogs
      so their behavior and characteristics tend to vary. They are said to be a
      manâ€™s best friend. Personally I prefer cats, dogs are just too energetic
      for me.
